## üöÄ **Overview**

This project leverages a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for document classification. The model is capable of classifying financial documents or stock symbol-related data into risk categories, providing key insights into the classification. The web app includes a Flask backend, an interactive frontend.
---

## ‚ú® **Features**

- **Text Extraction**: Extracts financial data from stock symbols or uploaded PDF/TXT files.
- **Risk Classification**: Classifies financial documents or data into predefined risk categories using a fine-tuned BERT model.
- **Financial Data Fetching**: Automatically fetches data related to the stock symbol from a free API.
- **User Interface**: Interactive web interface to input stock symbols, text, or upload financial documents.
- **Key Insights**: Displays key statistics and features that influence the risk classification.

## üìÇ **Contents**

- `app.py`: Flask backend to handle user inputs, API requests, and return classification results.
- `models/`: Contains `config.json` and `model.safetensors` for the BERT model.
- `templates/index.html`: Frontend HTML for the user interface.
- `static/style.css`: Custom CSS for styling the web interface.
- `static/script.js`: JavaScript for dynamic frontend behavior.
- `financial_model_training.py` : Python Script to train **BERT Model** and save it.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration for containerizing the project.

2. **Install the required packages**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. **Run the Model Training Script**:
   Train the BERT model and generate `config.json` and `model.safetensors` using the provided Python script:
   ```bash
   python3 financial_model_training.py

5. **Run the Flask App**:
   To start the web app locally:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
